# Design Notes

This section gives references, citations, and justifications for OED rules. We do the research so you don't have to.

## Origins of OED Expanded
OED Expanded origins begin with Delta's work in creating an easy to remember approach to original D&D, extensivly documented on his blog: https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/.  The work for OED Expanded intself began from my (Baquies) desire to have an all-in-one document for the OED system.  This started as just compiling the house rules from OEDgames.com, filling in the gaps with info from the 3 original books, extensive parsing of the OED footnotes and Delta's blog, and finally creating prose to communicate the rules.  Over time it contnued to evolve to include all things OED, and Delta's rules, various "Additional Material" from the blog and WanderingDMs discord, and finally a Judges "Missing Manual" in the form of the Campaign Material appendix.  
The final efforts were shared with Delta, which of course led to rounds of revisions, discussions, clarifications, and changes (Both to OED Expanded, and OED itself).  From this years long collaboration grew the OED Expanded Gitub, and this document.

## Fighter Feat Sources

The motivation for the Fighter Feats system is to replicate various benefits accrued to Fighters over the evolution of the O/AD&D game system. It may be of interest to note the source of inspiration for the feats we've selected, given below. Note that we don't attempt to match the exact mechanics in those sources; we've carefully balanced the effects in the context of our OD&D-based system.

| Feat                  | Inspiration                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Berserking            | Berserkers in Vol-2, Sup-IV (Odin), Dragon #3.            |
| Exceptional Strength  | Fighter strength percentile in Greyhawk/AD&D PHB.         |
| Great Fortitude       | Paladin immunity to disease in Greyhawk/AD&D PHB.         |
| Iron Will             | Cavalier resistance to mental attacks in AD&D UA.         |
| Mounted Combat        | Cavalier mounted combat bonuses in AD&D UA.               |
| Rapid Shot            | Bow double attacks in Chainmail/AD&D PHB.                 |
| Rapid Strike          | Fighter multiple attacks in AD&D PHB.                     |
| Survival              | Barbarian survival skill in AD&D UA.                      |
| Toughness             | Barbarian increased hit points in AD&D UA.                |
| Tracking              | Ranger tracking in TSR #2/AD&D PHB/UA.                    |
| Two Weapon Fighting   | Two weapon option in AD&D DMG (parry from Chainmail).     |
| Weapon Specialization | Fighter weapon specialization in AD&D UA.                 |

Put another way, the various O/AD&D fighter subclasses can be approximated by selection of various feats (or, of course, the player can flexibly mix-and-match to taste). The following are suggested as the first three feats for each subclass (to 12th level):

| Subclass        | Feat Selections                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Fighter (basic) | Exceptional strength, weapon specialization, rapid strike |
| Barbarian       | Berserking, toughness, survival                           |
| Cavalier        | Mounted combat, weapon specialization, iron will          |
| Paladin         | Great fortitude, iron will, rapid strike                  |
| Ranger          | Tracking, survival, two-weapon fighting                   |

## Book Costs

For real-world book costs, consider the following blog by Aidan Conti as a starting point. Cites incscriptions in some medieval books indicating manufacture & cost. One breaks down costs as about 8 s. for parchment, 29 s. forscribing, 3 s. for correcting, 1 s. illustration, 1 s. for binding; total 42 s. (Note that about 1/5 the cost is for parchment & binding; compare to costs for complete spellbooks at the end of OD&D Vol-1. Also, those books assume an entire level of spells per Vol-1, which average about 12 spells each. See AD&D Unearthed Arcana for expected size of books, etc. We assume 1st-level wizards appear with pre-existing books from their apprenticeship. Books can't be _too_ valuable or the main influx of money to the campaign will be new wizard PCs.)
